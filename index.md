EDUCATION

​
<!--

PhD, Performance Studies/Sociology, Goldsmiths University of London, 2020

My practice-based doctoral thesis focuses on the creation of alternative emancipatory spaces of everyday life, through transgressive performances. I specifically look into singing by Iranian women and how, with all the cultural and legal obstacles, they find ways to express themselves through their voice. Exploring tactics with which to reclaim space used by women, I propose focusing on the body and the ephemerality of performance.
