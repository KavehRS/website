As my main language of choice was (and is) <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>, I tried to look for frameworks written in Python. Many options came to mind, including <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a> and many others. One of the biggest challenges I have faced was that none of them supported graph-based databases natively, meaning that they help the developer quickly get up and running with minimum amount of code. At that time I had to use one of the available Object-Graph Mappers (OGM) and would have to write my own set of functions to handle CRUD on database models. Such a simple thing for many other SQL and some NoSQL databases would lead to thousands of lines of code to handle creation, deletion and modification of nodes and their relationships.</p> <p>After struggling to find such a framework, I decided to write my own set of functions as views to handle different endpoints I needed to get the job done.</p> <p>As I have used and worked with Flask in other projects, I decided to go the path of using a micro-framework and develop what I needed and use available extensions. To quickly get up and running I used <a href="https://github.com/apiguy/flask-classy">Flask-Classy</a> which is an extension of the Flask framework that supports class-based views for each endpoint supporting various HTTP verbs. It has been deprecated and I have replaced it with <a href="https://github.com/teracyhq/flask-classful">Flask-Classful</a>, which is a fork of the same project, but is actively developed.</p> <p>My OGM of choice was (and still is) <a href="https://github.com/robinedwards/neomodel">Neomodel</a>, a very-well documented, feature-rich OGM for the Neo4j database. Neomodel had all the abstraction I wanted to quickly develop a set of models for nodes and their relations.</p> <p>Mixing Flask, Flask-Classy, Neomodel allowed me to write a big class containing all the methods to expose views of my database models. I named the class generic_view, so that I can subclass it for each view and use it to serve each endpoint.</p> <p>Everything was fine until I thought that I should pay back to the FOSS community. So I decided to extract that piece of code from the project and make it a separate project that can be used as a simple extension to the Flask framework.</p> <p>So, I created <a href="https://github.com/mostafa/grest">gREST</a>, a restful API development framework on top of Python, Flask, Neo4j and Neomodel. Its primary purpose is to ease development of restful APIs with little effort and minimum amount of code.</p> <p>I used to make it a python package and distribute it on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pygrest/">PYPI</a>. I wrote unit-tests, a simple README and two simple examples to help developers know more about the workings of gREST.</p> <p>I also used <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> for my unit-tests, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/mostafa/grest">Travis-CI</a> for continuous integration and running tests, <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/mostafa/grest">Coveralls</a> for code coverage and <a href="https://gitter.im/pygrest/Lobby">Gitter</a> for a place to answer developers’ questions. As I was concerned about the licensing of the project, I have released it under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GPLv3</a> license and used the <a href="https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmostafa%2Fgrest/refs/branch/master">FOSSA</a> license check services to know if there are licensing mismatches. The FOSSA team deserves a medal for its service.</p> <p>It’s more than a year from the time I created my initial commit of the project and as per analytics, it has been downloaded more than 36,000 times and growing.</p> <figure class=""> <img src="/assets/images/grest-download-stats.jpg" alt="Download count of the gREST framework according to the Google BigQuery results on the the-psf:pypi dataset"/> <figcaption> Download count of the gREST framework according to the Google BigQuery results on the the-psf:pypi dataset </figcaption> </figure> <p>As I have twitted about it when I’ve made the project public, it has also been featured on the <a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/this-week-neo4j-29-april-2017/">Neo4j’s blog</a>.</p> <p>Last but not least, I tried my best to fix bugs and make improvements to the initial idea of gREST, but it needs the help of the community to be further developed. I also hope that it continues to serve the community well. My next article would be a tutorial on making a simple restful API using gREST.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>At the time of writing this article, there was only 36k downloads, while now, June 24 2020, it’s almost 120k, according to <a href="https://pepy.tech/project/pygrest">PePy</a>, which, I think, is impressive.</em></p> </section> <footer class="page__meta"> <p class="page__date"><strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-calendar-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Updated:</strong> <time datetime="2020-06-05">June 5, 2020</time></p> </footer> <section class="page__share"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=mosimoradian&text=The+Story+of+gREST%2C+A+Graph-based+Restful+API+Development+Framework%20https%3A%2F%2Fmostafa.dev%2Fblog%2Fthe-story-of-grest-a-graph-based-restful-api-development-framework" class="btn btn--twitter" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'window', 'left=20,top=20,width=500,height=500,toolbar=1,resizable=0'); return false;" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmostafa.dev%2Fblog%2Fthe-story-of-grest-a-graph-based-restful-api-development-framework" class="btn btn--facebook" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'window', 'left=20,top=20,width=500,height=500,toolbar=1,resizable=0'); return false;" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmostafa.dev%2Fblog%2Fthe-story-of-grest-a-graph-based-restful-api-development-framework" class="btn btn--linkedin" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'window', 'left=20,top=20,width=500,height=500,toolbar=1,resizable=0'); return false;" title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> LinkedIn</span></a> </section> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="#" class="pagination--pager disabled">Previous</a> <a href="/blog/the-story-of-farhang-a-bilingual-dictionary-production-system" class="pagination--pager" title="The Story of Farhang, A Bilingual Dictionary Production System ">Next</a> </nav> </div> <div class="page__comments"> <h4 class="page__comments-title">Comments</h4> <section id="disqus_thread"></section> </div> </article> <div class="page__related"> <h4 class="page__related-title">You May Also Enjoy</h4> <div class="grid__wrapper"> <div class="grid__item"> <article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"> <h2 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/devrel-content-strategies" rel="permalink">DevRel Content Strategies </a> </h2> <p class="page__meta"><i class="far fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 1 minute read </p> <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">The very first developer relations online meetup of Stockholm was streamed live on Facebook on April 15, 2020.
